\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\section{Basic notions and notation}
Let $N = \set{1, 2}$ be the set of individuals and $\allalts$ be the set of alternatives, with $\card{\allalts} = m\geq 2$. 
Given $i \in N$, let $\ibar \in N \setminus \set{i}$ denote the other individual. Let $\powersetz{\allalts}$ denote the set of non-empty subsets of $\allalts$. Let $\linors$ be the set of linear orders over $\mathcal{A}$. We let $\succ \in \linors$ stand for the preference of an individual, written as $\succ_i$ when it belongs to $i\in N$. We write $\prof =(\succ_1,\succ_2) \in \allprofs$ for a (preference) profile. A social choice rule (SCR) is a function $f: \allprofs → \powersetz{\allalts}$.
Given two SCRs $f$, $f'$, we write $f \subset f'$ to indicate that $f$ is a proper subcorrespondence of $f'$.

An SCR $f$ is anonymous iff $f(\prefi[1], \prefi[2]) = f(\prefi[2], \prefi[1])$ for all $(\succ_1,\succ_2) \in \allprofs$.
An SCR $f$ is neutral iff for all permutations $\sigma$ over $\allalts$ and profile $\prof \in \allprofs$, $\sigma \circ f(\prof) = f(\sigma \circ \prof)$.

Given $j, l \in \N$, let $\intvl{j, l} = [j, l] \cap \N $ denote the interval of integer numbers between $j$ and $l$.
The loss vector of $x$ at $\prof$ is $\lprof(x) \in \intvl{0, m - 1}^N$ that associates to each individual her “loss” resulting of selecting $x$ instead of his favorite alternative, that loss being defined as the number of alternatives that the individual prefers to $x$: $\lprof(x)_i = \card{\set{y \in \allalts \suchthat y \prefi x}}$.
%Let $\bigcup_{k \in \losses}(k^N)$ denote the set of constant loss vectors.
Given two loss vectors $l, l' \in \lvs$, we say that $l$ is strictly smaller than $l'$, $l < l'$, iff $\forall i: l_i ≤ l'_i \land l ≠ l'$. We also write $l ≤ l'$ to denote that $l$ is weakly smaller than $l'$, meaning, strictly smaller or equal. Let $\min_N \lprof(x) = \min_{i \in N} \lprof(x)_i \in \N$ and $\sum_N \lprof(x) = \sum_{i \in N} \lprof(x)_i$ denote, respectively, the minimal loss level and the sum of the losses, considering the loss vector $\lprof(x)$.

Let $\PD = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \exists y \text{ s.t. } \lprof(y) < \lprof(x)}$ be the Pareto-dominated alternatives in $\prof$. Let $\PE = \allalts \setminus \PD$ be the Pareto-efficient ones.

\section{Four SCRs of the literature}
Given $\prof$ and a loss level $k \in \losses$, define $U(\prof, k) = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x) ≤ (k, k)}$ as the set of alternatives imposing losses not higher than $k$ for all individuals. We say that such alternatives receive unanimous support at level $k$.
Let $\rhoP = \min \set{k \in \losses \suchthat U(\prof, k) ≠ \emptyset}$ be the least loss level at which some alternative receives unanimous support. By Theorem 1 of Brams and Kilgour (2001) we have $\forall \prof \in \allprofs$, $\rhoP ≤ \ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$.

Given a profile $\prof \in \allprofs$, let H(\prof) = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x) ≤ (\ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}}, \ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}})}$ denote the set of alternatives reaching the best half of every individual’s preference.
In concordance with the ceiling established by Theorem 1 of Brams and Kilgour (2001), we use the term “half” to mean the smallest integer $k$ that exceeds $m-k$.

\textbf{Fallback Bargaining} is the SCR $\FB$ that picks all alternatives with unanimous support at $\rhoP$: $\FB(\prof) = U(\prof, \rhoP)$. 

The \textbf{Veto-rank} rule $\VR$\footnote{\label{ft:modd} Both $\VR$ and $\SL$ are defined in Clippel et al.XXX for $m$ odd only.} is defined as follows. Each individual vetoes her worst $\floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$ alternatives, then the Borda winners among the non vetoed alternatives are picked: $\VR(\prof) = \argmin_{H(\prof)} \sum_N \lprof = \set{x \in H(\prof) \suchthat \forall y \in H(\prof): \sum_N \lprof(x) ≤ \sum_N \lprof(y)}$.

The \textbf{Shortlisting} rule $\SL$\footref{ft:modd} picks the best alternative of individual $1$ that is not among the worst $\floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$ alternatives of individual $2$, and the best alternative of $2$ that is not among the worst $\floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$ alternatives of $1$. Formally, $\SL(\prof) = \cup_{i \in N} (\argmin_{x \in H^i(\prof)} \lprof(x)_{\ibar})$.

The class of \textbf{Pareto-and-veto} rules, $\PVcl$, contains rules parameterized by $v_1, v_2 \in \intvl{0, m - 1}$ with $v_1 + v_2  ≤ m - 1$ where $v_i$ represents the number of alternatives vetoed by individual $i \in N$ (individuals veto the alternatives at the bottom of their preference).
Given $v_i \in \intvl{0, m - 1}$, define $a_i = m - v_i - 1 \in \intvl{0, m - 1}$ as the highest acceptable loss level for individual $i$. For $v=(v_1,v_2)$, the rule $PV^v = \cap_{i \in N}\set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x)_i ≤ a_i} \cap \PE$ picks all alternatives in $\PE$ that no individual vetoes. 
The class $\PVcl = \set{PV^v \suchthat v_1,v_2 \in \intvl{0, m - 1} \: \text{ with } v_1+v_2\leq m-1}$ is the set of those rules.

\begin{remark}
     $\FB, \VR, \SL$ and all SCSs in $\PVcl$ are  neutral. $\FB$, $\VR$ and $\SL$ are also anonymous, while a SCR in $\PVcl$ is anonymous iff $v_1 = v_2$.
\end{remark}


We start by observing that $\VR$, $\SL$ and $\FB$ can pick disjoint winners.
\begin{proposition}
	$\exists \prof \suchthat \VR(\prof) \cap \SL(\prof) = \emptyset, \VR(\prof) \cap \FB(\prof) = \emptyset, \SL(\prof) \cap \FB(\prof) = \emptyset$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	\Cref{fig:disjoint} proves the statement.
\end{proof}

To discuss the relationship of $\FB$, $\SL$ and $\VR$ to members of $\PVcl$, we define a condition that we call the first half property, which mandates that the rule picks its winners among the alternatives placed in the best half of both rankings.
\begin{definition}[First half (FH)]
	$\forall \prof \in \allprofs: f(\prof) \subseteq H(\prof)$.
\end{definition}
Let $\PEcl$ denote the class of rules picking only Pareto efficient alternatives ($\forall \prof: f(\prof) \subseteq \PE$); $\FHcl$ denote the class of rules satisfying the First half property, and similarly for other properties defined in this article.

The next proposition shows that $\VR$, $\SL$ and $\FB$ satisfy FH.
\begin{proposition}
	$\VR, \SL, \FB \in \FHcl$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	This follows immediately from the definition of $\VR$ and $\FB$. \commentOC{Do we need to prove anything for $\SL$?}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	$\PVcl ∩ \FHcl = \{PV^v \in \mathcal{PV} \mid v_i \geq \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}} \forall i \}$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider a arbitrary ordering $\prefi$ over $\allalts$, let $\prefiinv$ denote its inverse, and consider a profile $\prof = (\prefi, \prefiinv)$. Observe that $PV^v(\prof) = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x) = (a_1, a_2) \text{ when } v_1+v_2=m-1}$. 
	This permits to see that $PV^v$ with $v_1+v_2=m-1$ satisfies FH iff $a_1, a_2 ≤ \ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$, equivalently, iff $v_1, v_2 ≥ \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$.
	\commentOC{This is probably a bit too quick.}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
For $m$ odd only, $v_1=v_2=\frac{m-1}{2}$ is FH.\\
For $m$ even, there are SCRs that are FH: $v_1=v_2=\frac{m}{2}-1$; $v_1=\frac{m}{2}$, $v_2=\frac{m}{2}-1$ and $v_1=\frac{m}{2}-1$, $v_2=\frac{m}{2}$.
\end{corollary}
Considering two SCRs $f$ and $f'$, let $f \cup f'$ denote the rule $(f \cup f')(\prof) = f(\prof) \cup f'(\prof)$. 
Given any non empty class of SCRs $F$, let $\bigcup F$ denote the maximal (least resolute) SCR that can be formed by unions of rules of $F$.
Say that a class of rules $F$ is closed under union whenever $\forall f, f' \in F: f \cup f' \in F$. 
Given any non empty class of SCRs $F$ closed under union, the maximal SCR formed by unions of rules of $F$ is a member of $F$, and (evidently) is less resolute than any other member of $F$. Formally: $[f = \bigcup(F)] ⇔ [(\forall f' \in F, f' \subseteq f) \land (f \in F)]$.

\commentRS{Show that there is a unique SCR that is PE, FH and set inclusion maximal which is PVe. Te proof remarks that FH and PE is closed under union.}

\commentOC{Phrase this as: For all $m$, this union is the union of PVecl.}

\begin{proposition}
	For $m$ odd, $\bigcup(\PEcl \cap \FHcl) = \PVe$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	%Both classes $\PEcl$ and $\FHcl$ are closed under union. Thus, $\PEcl \cap \FHcl$ is closed under union.
	Define $f$ as the rule that always picks all efficient alternatives ranked in both first halves. This is the least resolute SCR among the class $\PEcl \cap \FHcl$. And it equals $\PVe$.
	\commentOC{To be continued, I suppose. But it seems we do not need the union-closed stuff here.}
\end{proof}

In the next proposition, in fact, conjecture, we use max in the sense of set inclusion (irresoluteness).
\begin{proposition}
	$\max {(\PEcl \cap \FHcl \cap \PVcl)} = \PVecl$.
\end{proposition}

Corollary: A SCR F is FH and Pareto iff F is a subcorrespondence of PV-equalvetoes.”




\commentRS{Show also that FB, SL and VR are subcorrespondences of a PV rule iff that PV rule is PVe. Tje proposition below partly handles that}

\commentOC{Show that this is strict by using the same figure.}
\begin{proposition}
	$\SL, \VR, \FB \subset \PVe$
\end{proposition}

\commentOC{Say that PVe is the FH; SL is max max among the FH; VR maximizes the sum of gains; and FB maximizes the min gain.}


\commentRS{Below are characterizations}
PV-e iff PE, FH, MAskin monotonicity

I recall from a paper of Vincent that FB is characterized by using a Rawlsian maximin axiom plus maximality 

For SL and VR we should look at Clippel. 

\color{green} MN: no characterization of VR to the best of my knowledge \color{black}

Sertel shows (says Danilo Coelho) that the unanimous compromise set (the FB winners?) is the set of Pareto efficient candidates that maximize the worst-of welfare (welfare = nb alternatives less good than the chosen one). \color{green} MN: This is true, right? \color{black}



\section{New SCRs}
\subsection{Based on equal loss}
\begin{definition}[Equal loss (EL)]
\color{green}	$f$ picks some alternative ranked the same by everybody, if any. \color{black}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Paretian equal loss (PEL)]
	$f$ must pick solely the alternative ranked the same by everybody and that is efficient, if there is one.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Paretian compromism compatibility (PCC)]
	Define $\Sigma = \set{\sigma \in (\R^+)^{(\lvs)} \suchthat \sigma^{-1}(0) = \cup_{k \in \losses}(k^N)}$ be the set of all spread measures that attribute the minimal inequality measure to the constant loss vectors and none others.
	\commentOC{Could we perhaps define sigma as a weak order over the loss vectors?}
	$f$ is PCC iff there exists a spread measure $\sigma \in \Sigma$ such that $\forall \prof: f(\prof) \cap \minspread[\PE] ≠ \emptyset$.
\end{definition}

Call the dispersion of a loss vector $l$ at $\prof$ the value $d(l) = \abs{l_1 - l_2}$. 
Note that $d \in \Sigma$ and seems to coincide with multiple commonly used spread measures (to be verified). 
Thus, $(d \circ \lprof)(x) = \max\lprof(x) - \min\lprof(x)$.
\begin{definition}[Dispersion compromism]
	$\forall \prof: f(\prof) \subseteq \mindisp[\PE]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Dispersion phobia]
	If $x$ has a strictly higher dispersion than $y$ at $\prof$, then $f$ may not pick $x$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Loss vector comparing (LVC)]
	Let $\succeq$ be a weak order on $\lvs$. The rule $f^\succeq$ selects all alternatives whose loss vectors are minimal elements of $\restr{{\succeq}}{\lprof(\alts)}$. A rule satisfies LVC iff $\exists {\succeq} \suchthat f = f^\succeq$. (This property is called preorder based in Cailloux and Endriss 2014.)
\end{definition}

\commentOC{I do not understand this.}
A stronger version of PEL is what we used in the paper with Beatrice. Fix a set SIGMA of “acceptable” equality measures and ask from F to always pick an alternative with equal loss according to some member of SIGMA. This is stronger than PEL because being “acceptable” requires that an alternative at the same rank for both players as the most equal loss.

$Paretianism ∩ EL = \emptyset$.



\begin{proposition}
VR, SL, and all rules in PV fail PEL
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
FB satisfies PEL
\end{proposition}


PV, FB, SL and VR, all fail strong PEL. 

In fact, strong PEL and FH are incompatible conditions. 


What are interesting rules that satisfy this stronger version of PEL? 

As Matias suggested, can we use strong PEL to refine VR, SL or FB?

Can we identify an interesting SCR that satisfies strong PEL?

\subsection{Based on refining}
Discuss how discriminative the four rules are. ll four rules are irresolute. Do they have refinements that are anonymous and neutral? The answer is obviously affirmative for PV (as the remaining three rules do the job) but should be addressed for FB, SL and VR. 
The Theorem, stated at the end of page 4 (\hrefblue{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00187429}{Sprumont}), is about refinements of FB. It says that FB admits refinements that satisfy the two conditions of the paper, namely CPB and SO. Moreover, any rule that satisfies CPB and SO is a refinement of FB.

We can refer to this when we address the question of refining FB, SL and VR.









\subsection{Rules we invent}
Anonymized PV rules
PV when the sum of vetoes is less than m-1
\section{Miscellaneous comments}
I proposed: [VR selects equal loss ⇒ VR selects all alternatives with "almost equal loss"], but this is contradicted by: (abc; cba).


Danilo Coelho seems to be interested in implementation of FB and shortlisting and related rules (see the \href{https://www.cmss.auckland.ac.nz/2020/06/03/online-social-choice-seminar-series/}{Online Social Choice Seminar})

\color{green}MN: Yes, I agree. By the way, in his paper, he cites a paper by Clippel with a new characterization of Fallback, we might want to cite it.\color{black}
