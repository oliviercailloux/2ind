\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Two-person discrete social choice models allow a specific interpretation of collective decision making: Bargaining over a finite set of alternatives. Since the seminal model of Nash (1950), for a long time, bargaining problems were formulated over a convex set of alternatives. However, there are many instances where bargaining takes place over a finite set of alternatives. Thus, this simplifying assumption of Nash (1950) excludes several real-life situations. 

Mariotti (1998) is among the first to relax this assumption by characterizing the Nash solution for a finite set of alternatives. His approach is followed by Nagahisa and Tanaka (2002) who, again in a finite setting, characterize the solution of Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975). Both characterizations are built in a cardinal framework. 
 
An ordinal framework of two-person finite bargaining problems is presented by Brams and Kilgour (2001) who introduce and analyze an ordinal solution, namely \textit{fallback bargaining}, that is based on compromising where each of the two bargainers begins by claiming the best outcome with respect to his ranking of alternatives. When the claims of the two bargainers differ, they continue by falling back, in lockstep, to lower ranked alternatives until a mutually (hence unanimously) agreed outcome is found. As this solution is presented in a model that does not admit a disagreement point, fallback bargaining is rather an arbitration rule than being a bargaining solution. An analysis of fallback bargaining in a model with a disagreement point is made by Kıbrıs and Sertel (2007) who rebaptize the solution as \textit{unanimity compromise} and define several variants of it. One of these variants, the \textit{imputational compromise}, is further studied by Conley and Wilkie (2012).
 
As a matter of fact, the compromising approach that underlies fallback bargaining was originally used to design voting rules in settings with more than two individuals with the required support varying from unanimity to simple majority, such as the \textit{Kant-Rawls Social Compromise} by Hurwicz and Sertel (1997) and the \textit{majoritarian compromise} by Sertel and Yilmaz (1999). It also paved the way to new axioms for social choice, such as \textit{efficiency in the degree of compromise} by Ozkal Sanver and Sanver (2004).  Merlin et al. (2019) present a recent comprehensive analysis of voting rules and axioms based on this compromising idea.
 
A closer look at fallback bargaining reveals a principle for two-person social choice. Sprumont (1993) qualifies arbitration rules that maximize the welfare of the least happy individual as being \textit{Rawlsian}. Theorem 3 of Brams and Kilgour (2001) shows the equivalence between the Rawlsian principle and fallback bargaining. Moreover, every individual ranks a fallback bargaining outcome in the upper half of his ranking (Brams and Kilgour 2001). Thus, asking from a social choice rule to always pick an alternative that is ranked among the first half of both players’ rankings presents a well-defined principle, which we qualify as being \textit{minimally Rawlsian}. 

Another principle for two-person social choice is proposed by Cailloux et al. (2022) who propose a different conception of compromising based on the \textit{equal loss principle} that favors outcomes where every individual concedes as equally as possible from his highest ranked alternative. Several two-person social choice rules that are minimally Rawlsian fail to comply with the equal loss principle, suggesting an incompatibility between these two principles.
 
Although the minimal Rawlsian and equal loss principles cover many of the two-person social choice rules, the literature is missing an axiomatic analysis of these rules from this perspective, an observation which forms the subject matter of our paper. We consider the following rules:

Fallback bargaining, as defined by Brams and Kilgour (2001);

The \textit{veto-rank mechanism} where, given an odd number m of alternatives, each individual vetoes $(m−1) / 2$ alternatives and ranks the remaining $(m+1) / 2$. The outcome is the alternative with the minimal sum of ranks among those that have not been vetoed. This mechanism, used for the selection of arbitrators, is comprehensively analyzed by de Clippel et al. (2014).


The \textit{shortlisting procedure} where one individual selects $(m+1) / 2$ alternatives and the other individual decides on the outcome out of that shortlist. This is also a mechanism that is used for the selection of arbitrators and comprehensively analyzed by de Clippel et al. (2014).


The class of \textit{Pareto-and-veto rules} where each individual i vetoes a fixed number $v_i$ of alternatives with $v_1$ + $v_2$ being lower than the total number of alternatives m. The outcome is the set of Pareto optimal alternatives that are not vetoed. This class generalizes the Pareto-and-veto rules analyzed by Laslier et al. (2021) which impose $v_1$ + $v_2$ = $m-1$.
  
This list of rules we consider covers most of the two-person social choice rules in the literature. The literature also admits various interesting real-life procedures expressed as extensive form games, such as those in Anbarci (1993, 2006) and Barberà and Coelho (2021). However, as shown in these papers, the subgame perfect equilibrium outcomes of these games are always among the alternatives that fallback bargaining would choose. 

We now summarize our findings. All rules we consider are Paretian. Fallback bargaining, the veto-rank mechanism and the shortlisting procedure are minimally Rawlsian. The class of Pareto-and-veto rules admits a single minimally Rawlsian member: the one that gives the highest equal veto power to both individuals, i.e., $v_1$ = $v_2$ = $m/2$ when the number $m$ of alternatives is odd and $v_1$ = $v_2$ = $(m-2)/2$ when $m$ is even. Moreover, this Pareto-and-veto rule is a super correspondence of every Paretian and minimally Rawlsian social choice rule. Thus, fallback bargaining, the veto-rank mechanism and the shortlisting procedure are all sub correspondences of the Pareto-and-veto rule with the highest equal veto power.

The equal loss principle we consider favors outcomes that have the same rank for both individuals. Without imposing Pareto optimality separately, this principle may lead to Pareto dominated outcomes. Thus, we consider a Paretian version that favors, among the Pareto optimal outcomes, the one that has the same rank for both individuals. Note that such an alternative, if it exists, will be unique. We define two versions of the Paretian equal loss principle, one being stronger than the other. The stronger version requires that the Pareto optimal alternative that has the same rank for both individuals must be uniquely chosen. Under the weaker version it suffices that this alternative be among the outcomes. The veto-rank mechanism and the shortlisting procedure both fail the weak (hence strong) version of the Paretian equal loss principle.  While some Pareto-and-veto rules, namely xxxxx satisfy the weak Paretian equal loss principle, all of them fail the strong version. On the other hand, fallback bargaining satisfies the strong version of the Paretian equal loss principle, thus showing that this principle is compatible with being minimally Rawlsian. 



Within the spirit of equal loss, we propose the \textit{weak minimal dispersion principle} as another strengthening of the weak equal loss principle. The \textit{dispersion} of an alternative is the difference between the two ranks at which is it placed at the preferences of the two individuals. The weak minimal dispersion principle requires that an alternative whose dispersion is minimal must be among the outcomes. This principle turns out to be logically incompatible with the minimal Rawlsian principle, thus being failed by fallback bargaining.

\section{Basic notions and notation}

Let $N$ be a set of two individuals and $\allalts$ be a set of alternatives, with $\card{\allalts} = m\geq 2$. 
Given $i \in N$, let $\ibar \in N \setminus \set{i}$ denote the other individual. Let $\powersetz{\allalts}$ denote the set of non-empty subsets of $\allalts$. Let $\linors$ be the set of linear orders over $\mathcal{A}$. We let $\prefi \in \linors$ stand for the preference of individual  $i \in N$ and $\prof = ({\prefi[1]}, {\prefi[2]}) \in \allprofs$ for a preference profile. A social choice rule (SCR) is a function $f: \allprofs → \powersetz{\allalts}$.
Given two SCRs $f$, $f'$, we write $f \subset f'$ to indicate that $f$ is a proper subcorrespondence of $f'$.

An SCR $f$ is anonymous iff $f({\prefi[1]}, {\prefi[2]}) = f({\prefi[2]}, {\prefi[1]})$ for all $({\prefi[1]}, {\prefi[2]}) \in \allprofs$.
An SCR $f$ is neutral iff for all permutations $\sigma$ over $\allalts$ and profile $\prof \in \allprofs$, $\sigma \circ f(\prof) = f(\sigma \circ \prof)$.

Given $p, q \in \N$, let $\intvl{p, q} = [p, q] \cap \N $ denote the interval of integer numbers between $p$ and $q$. The loss of individual $i$ at preference profile $\prof$ for alternative $x$ is  defined as the number of alternatives that the individual prefers to $x$: $\lprof(x)_i = \card{\set{y \in \allalts \suchthat y \prefi x}}$.
The loss vector of $x$ at $\prof$, $\lprof(x)=(\lprof(x)_1, \lprof(x)_2) \in \intvl{0, m - 1}^N$, associates to each individual her loss associated to $x$.

%Let $\bigcup_{k \in \losses}(k^N)$ denote the set of constant loss vectors.
Given two loss vectors $l, l' \in \lvs$, we say that $l$ is weakly smaller than $l'$, $l ≤ l'$, iff $\forall i: l_i ≤ l'_i$. We also write $l < l'$ to denote that $l$ is strictly smaller than $l'$, meaning, weakly smaller and different. Let $\min_N \lprof(x) = \min_{i \in N} \lprof(x)_i \in \N$ 
and $\sum_N \lprof(x) = \sum_{i \in N} \lprof(x)_i$ denote, respectively, the minimal loss and the sum of the losses associated to $\lprof(x)$.

Let $\PE = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \nexists y \text{ s.t. } \lprof(y) < \lprof(x)}$ be the set of Pareto-efficient alternatives at $\prof$.
Let $\PEcl$ denote the class of SCRs picking only Pareto efficient alternatives: $\forall \prof: f(\prof) \subseteq \PE$.

We now define several SCRs that we analyze in the paper. 

Formally, given a profile $\prof \in \allprofs$ and an individual $i$, let $H^i(\prof) = \{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x)_i ≤ \ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}}\} $ denote the set of alternatives in the best half of player $i$'s preference. \commentRS{Do we need to define Hi}
Given a profile $\prof \in \allprofs$, let $H(\prof) = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x) ≤ (\ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}}, \ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}})}$ denote the set of alternatives reaching the best half of every individual’s preference. 
In concordance with the ceiling established by Theorem 1 of \cite{BramsKilgour2001}, we use the term “half” to mean the smallest integer $k$ that exceeds $m-k$.

Given $\prof$ and a loss level $k \in \losses$, define $U(\prof, k) = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x) ≤ (k, k)}$ as the set of alternatives imposing losses not higher than $k$ for all individuals. 
We say that such alternatives receive unanimous support at level $k$. Let $\rhoP = \min \set{k \in \losses \suchthat U(\prof, k) ≠ \emptyset}$ be the least loss level at which some alternative receives unanimous support.

\textbf{Fallback Bargaining} is the SCR $\FB$ that picks all alternatives with unanimous support at $\rhoP$: $\FB(\prof) = U(\prof, \rhoP)$. 

The \textbf{Veto-rank} rule $\VR$ is defined as follows. Each individual vetoes her worst $\floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$ alternatives, then the Borda winners among the non vetoed alternatives are picked: $\VR(\prof) = \argmin_{H(\prof)} \sum_N \lprof = \set{x \in H(\prof) \suchthat \forall y \in H(\prof): \sum_N \lprof(x) ≤ \sum_N \lprof(y)}$.

The \textbf{Shortlisting} rule $\SL$ picks the best alternative of individual $1$ that is not among the worst $\floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$ alternatives of individual $2$, and the best alternative of $2$ that is not among the worst $\floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$ alternatives of $1$. The Shortlisting rule is such that
$\SL(\prof) = \cup_{i \in N} (\argmin_{x \in H^i(\prof)} \lprof(x)_{\ibar})$.

Both $\VR$ and $\SL$ are defined in \cite{Clippel} for $m$ odd only.

The class of \textbf{Pareto-and-veto} rules, $\PVcl$, contains rules parametrized by $v_1, v_2 \in \intvl{0, m - 1}$ with $v_1 + v_2  ≤ m - 1$ where $v_i$ represents the number of alternatives vetoed by individual $i \in N$ (individuals veto the alternatives at the bottom of their preference).
Given $v_i \in \intvl{0, m - 1}$, define $a_i = m - v_i - 1 \in \intvl{0, m - 1}$ as the highest acceptable loss level for individual $i$. For $v=(v_1,v_2)$, the rule $\PVv = \cap_{i \in N}\set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x)_i ≤ a_i} \cap \PE$ picks all alternatives in $\PE$ that no individual vetoes. 
The class $\PVcl = \set{\PVv \suchthat v_1, v_2 \in \intvl{0, m - 1} \text{ with } v_1 + v_2 \leq m - 1}$ is the set of those rules, and the class $\PVbcl = \set{\PVv \suchthat v_1, v_2 \in \intvl{0, m - 1} \text{ with } v_1 + v_2 = m - 1}$ is the set of rules where the inequality is binding.

\begin{remark}
    $\FB$, $\VR$, $\SL$ and all SCRs in $\PVcl$ are  neutral.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    $\FB$, $\VR$ and $\SL$ are anonymous, while a SCR in $\PVcl$ is anonymous iff $v_1 = v_2$.
\end{remark}

\section{Minimal Rawlsian principle}
\begin{definition}[Minimal Rawlsian (MR)] A SCR satisfies MR if 
	$\forall \prof \in \allprofs,  f(\prof) \subseteq H(\prof)$.
\end{definition}
\commentOC{I now wonder if this definition is appropriate, wrt the name.}
Let $\mathcal{MR}$ denote the class of rules satisfying the Minimal Rawlsian (MR) property.

\begin{remark}
   \label{th:inFH}
    $\FB, \VR, \SL \in \PEcl \cap \mathcal{MR}$. 
\end{remark}
   

The remark follows from the definition of $\VR$ and $\SL$ since each of these rules selects only alternatives among the top-half alternatives of both individuals; and from Theorem 1 of \cite{BramsKilgour2001} which shows that $\forall \prof \in \allprofs$, $\rhoP ≤ \ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$.

We now discuss the relationship of the class $\PVcl$ to the $\mathcal{MR}$ property. To this end, we define $\PVe = \PVv[\left(\floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}, \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}\right)]$ as the Pareto-and-veto rule that gives the highest equal veto power to both individuals. 
Thus, under $PV^=$, we have $v_1=v_2= \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$, implying $v_1=v_2=\frac{(m-1)}{2}$ when $m$ is odd and $v_1=v_2= \frac{m}{2}-1$ when $m$ is even. 
Note that $PV^=\in\PVbcl$ iff $m$ is odd.

\begin{proposition}\label{propo:diff}
    $\PVcl ∩ \mathcal{MR} = \set{\PVv \in \PVcl \suchthat \forall i: v_i ≥ \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	For the “if” part, note that given any profile, the condition $\forall i: v_i ≥ \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$ suffices to guarantee that $\PVv(\prof) \subseteq H(P)$.

	To see the “only if” part, consider an arbitrary ordering $\prefi$ over $\allalts$, let $\prefiinv$ denote its inverse, and consider the profile $\prof = (\prefi, \prefiinv)$.
	Observe that $\PVv(\prof)$ will exclusively pick winners in the first half of voter $i$ only if $v_i ≥ \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$.
\end{proof}
A direct implication of Proposition \ref{propo:diff}   is that the set of $\PVcl$ rules satisfying $\mathcal{MR}$ is quite reduced, as made explicit by the following remark.
\begin{remark}
    When $\forall i \in \set{1, 2}, v_i ≥ \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$, we have $\abs{v_1 - v_2} ≤ 1$.
	Thus, when $m$ is odd, $\PVcl ∩ \mathcal{MR} = \{PV^=\}$, and
	when $m$ is even, $\PVcl ∩ \mathcal{MR} = \set{\PVe, \PVv[(\frac{m}{2}, \frac{m}{2} - 1)], \PVv[(\frac{m}{2} - 1, \frac{m}{2})]}$.
\end{remark}

We now establish the relationship of  $\VR, \SL, \FB$ to the class $\PVcl$. Considering two SCRs $f$ and $f'$, let $f \cup f'$ denote the rule $(f \cup f')(\prof) = f(\prof) \cup f'(\prof)$. 
Given any non empty class of SCRs $F$, let $\bigcup F$ denote the maximal (least resolute) SCR that can be formed by unions of rules of $F$.

\begin{proposition}\label{propo:equal}
	$\bigcup(\PEcl \cap \mathcal{MR}) = \PVe$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Note that $\bigcup(\PEcl \cap \mathcal{MR})$ is, by definition, the SCR that, for each profile, picks all Pareto alternatives that are in the first half of both individuals’ preferences and only those alternatives. 
    We thus have to show that $\forall \prof: \PVe(\prof) = \PE \cap H(\prof)$. By definition of $\PVe$, it suffices to prove that $\cap_i\set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x)_i ≤ m - \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}} - 1} = H(\prof)$. This in turn follows from the definition of $H(\prof)$.
\end{proof}

The observation below follows from \cref{propo:equal}.
\begin{corollary}\label{th:subPVe}
	A SCR $f \in \PEcl \cap \mathcal{MR}$ if and only if $f \subseteq \PVe$.
\end{corollary}

We now establish the relationship between $\FB$, $\VR$ and $\SL$ and show that they can pick disjoint winners.
\begin{proposition}\label{th:different}
	$\exists \prof \suchthat \FB(\prof) \cap \VR(\prof) = \emptyset, \FB(\prof) \cap \SL(\prof) = \emptyset, \VR(\prof) \cap \SL(\prof) = \emptyset$. Furthermore, $\PVe(\prof) ≠ \FB(\prof)$, $\PVe(\prof) ≠ \VR(\prof)$, $\PVe(\prof) ≠ \SL(\prof)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the following profile $\prof$:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:distinct}
		\begin{array}{llll lll | llll ll}
			a&b&c&d&e&f&g&h&i&j&k&l&m\\
			g&h&i&d&b&j&a&c&e&f&k&l&m\\
		\end{array},
	\end{equation}
	where the first individual prefers $a$ to $b$, $b$ to $c$, etc., and the second individual prefers $g$ to $h$, $h$ to $i$, etc. 
	The bar shows the “half” position.
	The proposition is proven by noting that $\FB(\prof) = \set{d}$, $\VR(\prof) = \set{b}$, $\SL(\prof) = \set{a, g}$ and $\PVe(\prof) = \set{a, b, d, g}$.
\end{proof}

\Cref{th:inFH}, \cref{th:subPVe} and \cref{th:different} lead to the corollary below.
\begin{corollary}
   	$\FB, \VR, \SL \subset \PVe$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
    The rule $\PVe$ is not merely the union of $\FB$, $\VR$ and $\SL$, as the following profile illustrates.
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{array}{lllll|llll}
                a&b&c&d&e&f&g&h&i\\
                e&c&d&b&a&f&g&h&i\\
        \end{array}.
    \end{equation}
    Here, $\FB(\prof) = \set{c}$, $\VR(\prof) = \set{c}$, $\SL(\prof) = \set{a, e}$ but $\PVe(\prof) = \set{a, b, c, e}$. In fact, no variant of $\VR$ (changing the scoring vector) would elect $b$: its losses are $(1, 3)$ whereas $c$ has losses $(2, 1)$.
\end{remark}

\section{The equal loss principle}
Given $\prof \in \allprofs$, define $S(\prof) = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \lprof(x)_1 = \lprof(x)_2}$ as the set of alternatives that are ranked at the same position by both individuals.

\begin{definition}[Weak equal loss (WEL)]
    $\forall \prof \in \allprofs: [S(\prof) ≠ \emptyset] ⇒ f(\prof) \cap S(\prof) ≠ \emptyset$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    $\forall m ≥ 3: \PEcl ∩ \WELcl = \emptyset$.
\end{proposition}

Thus, Pareto efficiency is a fortiori incompatible with the following stronger version of the equal loss principle.

\begin{definition}[Equal loss (EL)]
    $\forall \prof \in \allprofs: [S(\prof) ≠ \emptyset] ⇒ f(\prof) \subseteq S(\prof)$.
\end{definition}

We now embed Pareto efficiency into the equal loss requirement by mandating $f$ to pick the (unique) Pareto efficient alternative that is ranked at the same position by both individuals, if there is one.

\begin{definition}[Weak Paretian equal loss (WPEL)]
    $\forall \prof \in \allprofs: [S(\prof) \cap PE(\prof) ≠ \emptyset] ⇒ f(\prof) \cap S(\prof) ≠ \emptyset$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	VR and SL fail WPEL.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the following profile $\prof$, reused from \cref{eq:distinct}, where $\VR(\prof) = \set{b}$ and $\SL(\prof) = \set{a, g}$:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{array}{llll lll | llll ll}
			a&b&c&d&e&f&g&h&i&j&k&l&m\\
			g&h&i&d&b&j&a&c&e&f&k&l&m\\
		\end{array}.
	\end{equation}
	WPEL requires to choose at least $d$.
\end{proof}

Some rules from the class $\PVcl$ satisfy WPEL, $\PVe$ being among those.
\begin{proposition}
	For any $m ≥ 3$, a PV rule $\PVv[(v_1, v_2)]$ satisfies WPEL iff its veto levels are both at most $\floor{\frac{m}{2}}$, thus, iff $\max_{i \in \set{1, 2}} v_i ≤ \floor{\frac{m}{2}}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	For all $\prof \in \allprofs$, if $x \in S(\prof) \cap \PE$, then $x$ is not among the last $\floor{\frac{m}{2}}$ ranks, because all alternatives before $x$ for the first voter must be placed after $x$ for the second voter.
	A PV rule with veto parameters at most $\floor{\frac{m}{2}}$ will thus pick all such alternatives $S(\prof) \cap \PE$, as required by WPEL.
	
	For the other direction, observe that there exists $\prof \in \allprofs$ such that for some $x \in \allalts$, $x \in S(\prof) \cap \PE$ and $x$ is positioned just better than the last $\floor{\frac{m}{2}}$ ranks (thus $\exists \prof \in \allprofs, x \in \allalts \suchthat \forall i \in \set{1, 2}: \lprof(x)_i = \floor{\frac{m - 1}{2}}$, leaving $\ceil{\frac{m - 1}{2}} = \floor{\frac{m}{2}}$ positions behind $x$).
	A PV rule such that $\max_{i \in \set{1, 2}} v_i > \floor{\frac{m}{2}}$ will thus not include $x$ in the set of winners, hence, the rule will fail WPEL.
\end{proof}

The rules that fail WPEL will a fortiori fail the following stronger version of the Paretian equal loss property.

\begin{definition}[Paretian equal loss (PEL)]
    $\forall \prof \in \allprofs: [S(\prof) \cap PE(\prof) ≠ \emptyset] ⇒ f(\prof) = S(\prof) \cap PE(\prof)$.
\end{definition}
Thus, VR, SL and those rules in PV that fail WPEL all fail PEL. Furthermore, as we state and show below, even the rules in PV that satisfy WPEL fail PEL.
\begin{proposition}
	When $m ≥ 4$, all rules in PV fail PEL.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $m = \set{a, b, c, a_4, a_5, …}$.
    Consider the following profile $P$: 
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{array}{llllll}
			a&b&c&a_4&a_5&…\\	c&b&a&a_4&a_5&…\\
		\end{array}.
	\end{equation}
    PEL requires to pick solely $b$. Any PV rule will pick at least either $a$ or $c$ in supplement to $b$. 
    Indeed, we have $a \notin f(\prof)$ iff $v_2 ≥ m - 2$, and $c \notin f(\prof)$ iff $v_1 ≥ m - 2$. Because $v_1 + v_2 ≤ m - 1$, it is impossible to have both $a \notin f(\prof)$ and $c \notin f(\prof)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
When $m = 3$, $PV^{(1, 1)}$ satisfies PEL.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
	FB satisfies PEL.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	\commentOC{TODO}
	If an alternative is Pareto and equal-loss, FB chooses it.

	Let $x$ be such an alternative and assume that FB does not pick it. Hence, there is some $y$ that Pareto dominates $x$, a contradiction.

	\commentOC{Suggestion (same idea with slightly more detail). 
	Consider any profile $\prof$, let $x \in PD(\prof)$ and $\lprof(x) = (k, k)$ for some $k \in \intvl{0, m - 1}$. Let us show that $FB(\prof) = \set{x}$.
	Observe that for any $y \in FB(\prof)$, $\max \lprof(y) ≥ \max \lprof(x) = k$ (as FB picks minimal worst loss alternatives). Thus, $y$ Pareto-dominates $x$. As also $x$ is Pareto-dominant, $x = y$.}
\end{proof}

Thus, by satisfying both conditions, FB establishes the compatibility between PEL and MR. However, as discussed below, this compatibility vanishes when another stronger version of WPEL is adopted. 

Call the dispersion of a loss vector $l$ at $\prof$ the value $d(l) = \abs{l_1 - l_2}$. 
Thus, $(d \circ \lprof)(x) = \max\lprof(x) - \min\lprof(x)$.
Note that $d \in \Sigma$ seems to coincide with multiple commonly used spread measures \commentOC{to be verified}. 

Given a profile $\prof \in \allprofs$, define $\min_{\PE} (d \circ \lprof)$ as the minimal dispersion obtained by loss vectors of Paretian alternatives in that profile, and $\argmin_{\PE} (d \circ \lprof)$ as the Paretian alternatives whose loss vectors have minimal dispersion among Paretian alternatives.

Define the weak minimal dispersion ($WMD$) condition as follows.
\begin{definition}[Weak minimal dispersion]
	$f(\prof) \cap \arg min_{\PE} (d \circ \lprof) ≠ \emptyset$, $\forall \prof \in \allprofs$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
 There is no $f \in \mathcal{MR}$ that satisfies WMD.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \commentOC{TODO}.
\end{proof}

Thus the minimal Rawlsian principle and WMD are logically incompatible. \commentOC{$\set{FB, VR, SL}$ are MR, thus, they fail WPEL. Also, all rules in PV fail PEL. Not all rules in PV fail WPEL. But do all rules in PV fail WMD?}

\section{Further axiomatizations of the rules}



Start by defining WMD restricted to MR alternatives (WMDMR).

WMDMR and WMD are logically independent.

The set of WMDMR alternatives forms a sub correspondence of FB.

This inclusion is proper. To describe the strictness of the inclusion, observe that at every profile, FB picks at most two alternatives. Profiles where it picks two alternatives, say x and y, must be of the following form:

…. x ……….y

 ……y………x

where in the dots no alternative appears twice. (Some of the dots may be empty.) Moreover, y for voter 1 and x for voter 2 are at the same level.

Now, x for voter 1 and y for voter 2 may or may not be at the same level. The first WMDMR refines FB when and only when they are not. 

Now consider another axiom, Rawlsian neutrality (RN): Define the social welfare of an alternative x at P, sw(x, P), as the lowest rank at which is is ranked by a voter. We say that F is RN iff given any P and any x, y with sw(x, P) = sw(y, P), we have x is in F(P) iff y is in F(P).

RN and MWDMR are logically independent and their conjunction is in turn equivalent to the maximin principle, thus characterizing FB.

Two papers two look at:

1. The Theorem, stated at the end of page 4 (\hrefblue{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00187429}{Sprumont}), is about refinements of FB. It says that FB admits refinements that satisfy the two conditions of the paper, namely CPB and SO. Moreover, any rule that satisfies CPB and SO is a refinement of FB. 

2. de Clippel, G. and Eliaz, F. "Reason Based Choice: a Bargaining Rationale for the
Attraction and Compromise E§ects." Theoretical Economics, Vol. 7 (2012), pp. 125-162.

Now, our rules other than FB:

$\PVe$ is equivalent to MR

VR is "Borda constrained to MR". This is very similar to the relationship between FB and WMDMR. Olivier claims that $\VR$ is the biggest rule satisfying both MR and the condition: $x \in f(\prof) ⇒ \sum(\lprof(x)) ≤ \min_{y \in H(\prof)} \sum(\lprof(y))$.

Short listing should be something around “maximax within the first half.” Again a claim of Olivier: Another condition requires that if $\exists y \in H(\prof) \suchthat \min(\lprof(y)) < \min(\lprof(x))$, then $x$ loses. Equivalently, $x \in f(\prof) ⇒ \min(\lprof(x)) ≤ \min_{y \in H(\prof)} \min(\lprof(y))$. The rule $\SL$ is the biggest rule satisfying both MR and that condition. (Note that these two conditions are independent.)

These four rules can also be compared by describing them as follows. \commentOC{Here is the description of $\SL$, which can be suitably adapted to other rules.} The $\SL$ rule is the rule that selects any alternative that is MR and that is not dominated by an MR alternative in terms of minimal welfare loses. More precisely, define $\prec$ as the following partial order on the set of loss vectors: $(a, b) \prec (c, d) ⇔ [(a, b) ≤^\text{MR} (c, d) \land \min\set{a, b} < \min\set{c, d}] \lor [(a, b) <^\text{MR} (c, d)]$, where $(a, b) ≤^\text{MR} (c, d)$ iff $(a, b)$ is first half. Then, $\SL$ selects $x$ iff it is an undominated element among the loss vectors that exist in $\prof$; formally, $f(\prof) = \set{x \in \allalts \suchthat \nexists y \in \allalts \suchthat y \prec x}$. 
Defining the uncomparability relation $\sim$ as $l_1 \sim l_2$ iff $l_1 \sim^\text{MR} l_2 \land \min l_1 = \min l_2$, we obtain the weak order ${\preceq} = {\prec} \cup {\sim}$, and $f(\prof) = \argmin^{\preceq}_{x \in \allalts} \lprof(x)$.
\commentOC{We could perhaps also describe $\prec$ as a union of relations, one of which is common to all rules.}

Finally can we characterize WMD as a rule?

\subsection{A attempt using a Leftist Principle}
Define the transformation $\prof$ to $\prof'_x$, with $x \suchthat \lprof(x) ≠ (k, k)$, as: swap $x$ with the alternative just above it for $v \suchthat \lprof(x)(v) ≥ \lprof(x)(v')$ and swap $x$ with the alternative just below it for $v'$.

Then, the Leftist Principle requires: $x \in f(\prof) ⇒ x \in f(\prof')$.

I think that FB satisfies it.

It seems that Pareto and LP are satisfied by FB and by the rule that picks all paretian alternatives.

Perhaps we need to add symmetry conditions and specificity ($\exists \prof \suchthat \card{f(\prof)} = 1$).
